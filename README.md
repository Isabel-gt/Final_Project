## Introduction

According to the CDC, the number of people who have diabetes in America is the highest it has ever been. People with diabetes have a deficiency in how their body makes or uses insulin.  Insulin is a important hormone that regulates glucose. It is essential that healthcare providers have the tools to screen patients for prediabetes or diabetes.  In this project, we intend to use supervised machine learning (classification)to predict diabetes, prediabetes or no diabetes. 

## Method

We used the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset from 2015 provided by Kaggle. The dataset was obtained by surveying hundreds of thousands of Americans for diabetes or prediabetes predictors.   We decided to explore 14 of the 22 variables for our prediction. Some of the questions that we explored were age, diet, physical activity and health history.  The data that we chose did not require extensive clean-up such as dropping NaN or columns therefore we were able to proceed in creating the model.  It was felt that a supervised machine learning was the best approach to classify and predict diabetes.  We used the tensorflow deep learning module. To compare for accuracy, we used the random forest method for this prediction.  We then began to build the webpage using HTML, Javascript, and Flask. To be continued...
